"""Gemini integration — the proxy's only external dependency.

Design rules:
  * Never raise to the caller. Every path returns a usable, SAFE value.
  * Identification falls back to "assume venomous" on any failure or low
    confidence. We never expose raw provider errors.
  * Summarisation falls back to a deterministic local sentence (mirroring the
    frontend composer) so the feature works even with no key / no network.
